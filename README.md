### Prediction of Intermittent Fluctuations from Surface Pressure Measurements on an Airfoil

Samuel H. Rudy and Themistoklis P. Sapsis

#### Overview

Software used for study of intermittent fluctuations of the flow around an airfoil.  Due to file size limits, the following files are not included in repository and must be generated locally;
1. Restart files from simulation in ./Re_17500/outfiles.  Generated by running simulation.
2. Velocity files saved as numpy arrays in ./Re_17500/numpy_files. Generated by save_velocity_files.py in ./Re_17500.
3. Saved weight files for FFNN in ./FFNN/P_to_Xi/saved_models. Generated by train_all_dims.sh in ./FFNN/P_to_Xi/core.
4. POD mode files (Phi.npy) in ./POD/POD_files.  Generated by get_POD.py in ./POD.
5. Error files for dynamic methods in {./POD/POD_LSTM_ROM/notebooks, ./FFNN/Xi_LSTM_ROM/notebooks, and ./P_LSTM_ROM/notebooks}.  Generated by running notebooks in respective folders.

#### Requires

Python version 3.5+
Minimal python requirements: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, tensorflow 2, numba, pymech.

Dataset generation requires installation of Nek5000 and dependencies.  Run time for airfoil simulation is approximately 3.5 hours on 128 threads.  Mesh generation uses gmsh.
